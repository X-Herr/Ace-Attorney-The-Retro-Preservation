# Ace-Attorney-The-Retro-Preservation
This project is about preserving all resources and content assets from Ace Attorney games on the Game Boy Advance and DS/DSi.

It includes: 
- Characters Animated Sprites
- Game Backgrounds
- In-Game Illustrations 
- Icons (Evidence, profiles, etc...)
- Pop-Ups 
- Effects

And more which you can access through this site.

All to be used by the Ace Attorney community in case creators based on this franchise or in any job in which you need them! You will wonder why specifically old rips, well, it is due to the love of retro simply that, all those renders in pixels are the beginning and legacy of this saga and they cannot be ignored as well as they must be respected as they should and that's why this project.
